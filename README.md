> A modern web application built with Next.js 14 and TypeScript

## Overview

This project is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a powerful React framework that enables features such as server-side rendering and static site generation. It was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) to provide a solid foundation for development.

## Features

- **Next.js 14**: Leveraging the latest features of Next.js
- **TypeScript Support**: Built-in type safety and enhanced developer experience
- **Font Optimization**: Utilizing `next/font` for optimal loading of Inter Google Font
- **Fast Refresh**: Instant feedback during development
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach for all screen sizes
